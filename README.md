# AdaRNN-DCORAL
The reference is from Du et al. titled "AdaRNN: Adaptive Learning and Forecasting of Time Series" for information on AdaRNN. Additionally, and the code assistance from the repository: https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/deep/adarnn

To achieve transfer learning for forecasting non-stationary traffic flow data, we integrate AdaRNN with the DCORAL algorithm.
